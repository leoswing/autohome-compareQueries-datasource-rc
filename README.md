Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
    * cd ./autohome-compareQueries-datasource-rc
    * npm install to install frontend dependencies.
    * npm exec playwright install chromium to install e2e test dependencies.
    * npm run dev to build (and watch) the plugin frontend code.
    * docker-compose up to start a grafana development server.
    * Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to create a dashboard to begin developing your plugin.
